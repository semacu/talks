### Abstract

The development of antibody and chemical methods to map modifications in DNA at different levels of resolution using sequencing approaches is beginning to reveal the natural diversity of chemical changes in the four canonical nucleobases adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G). The combination of these maps obtained in normal and disease states together with data obtained from genome-wide approaches measuring transcript levels (RNA-seq), distribution of nucleosomes (MNase-seq) and protein levels (as well as datasets available in GEO, ENCODE and literature) is starting to unveil potential biological functions for C and T modifications. This is an overview of the methods used to map and quantify levels of modified nucleobases in vitro and in vivo genome-wide experiments, and strategies to elucidate their function.
