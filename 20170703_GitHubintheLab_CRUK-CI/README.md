## Sharing code, figures and tables in the laboratory ... using GitHub

- 3rd July 2017 (2:45-3:30 pm), Room 313, Cancer Research UK - Cambridge Institute ([CRUK-CI](http://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/)), University of Cambridge, UK


### Summary

This will be a discussion with members of the CRUK-CI [Bioinformatics Core](http://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/core-facilities/bioinformatics-core). It will start with a broad overview of our efforts to share research computer code, figures and tables with our experimental collaborators in a robust and reproducible manner using [GitHub](https://github.com/). I will cover how we share while research projects develop, as well as during pre/post-publication. Finally I aim to discuss areas where we aim to improve further.

### Suggestions and ideas

- include versions of the manuscript preparation in our public github shares released with the publication
- freeze version of the software code when paper is published and continue further development in new versions
- [gitter](https://gitter.im/)
- GitLab allows hierarchies (subgroups) of [projects](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/group/subgroups/index.html)
